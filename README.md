# ewstools-flu-dataset

This is an implementation of the [ewstools](https://github.com/ThomasMBury/ewstools) library for predicting critical transistions on a US Flu data.

The CSD and DL based code was directly used from the [documentation of the library](https://github.com/ThomasMBury/ewstools/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_deep_learning.ipynb)


The flu data is from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub/main/target-data/target-hospital-admissions.csv) dataset.

Everything is implemented in the Colab Notebook.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions!
